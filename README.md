# Fall-Detector

Source files for the implementation of a Fall Detector.  
Implemented by using a TI CC3200 launchpad, OLED screen, and an onboard accelerometer. 

## Files

1. **Adafruit_GFX.c** : Contains definitions of functions that display things to the OLED.
2. **Adafruit_GFX.h** : Contains declarations of functions that display things to the OLED.
3. **Adafruit_OLED.c** : Contains definitions of functions that send data to OLED through SPI communication and display things to the OLED.
4. **Adafruit_SSD1351.h** : Contains declarations of functions that send data to OLED through SPI communication and display things to the OLED.
5. **glcdfont.h** : Contains an array of ASCII characters in hex format.
6. **i2c_if.c** : Contains definitions of functions that establish I2C communication.
7. **i2c_if.h** : Contains declarations of functions that establish I2C communication.
8. **main.c** : Main program implementation.
9. **uart_if.c** : Contains definitions of functions that establish Uart communication.
